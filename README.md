# sample-ios-app

An open-source sample mobile/iOS Dwolla app

## Version

1.0.0

## What is this?

The Dwolla sample iOS app is a fully functional native mobile application, developed in Objective C, with the sole purpose of letting other folks in the developer community play, fork, and distribute it freely.

You're more than welcome to use the code we've open sourced to learn how to use our [dwolla-ios](https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-ios) library to interact with the Dwolla API.  The sample application shows off some neat ways you can leverage the Dwolla API to facilitate mobile payments with ease.  To name a few features, this app implements Dwolla Spots to visualize nearby businesses that accept Dwolla, lets you make payments and request money, lets you see your recent transaction history, refill your account balance, and withdraw money from your account.

We invite developers to use any and all parts of the code for any and all possible intents.  Feel free to adapt this application in your own application (commercial, open-source, doesn't matter), or fork it and improve it, or pick it apart to learn from.

## Quick Start

To get started, simply plug in your Dwolla API Application credentials in the beginning of the DwollaAPI.m file. If you still don't have API credentials, head over to [dwolla.com/applications](https://www.dwolla.com/applications) to generate a free set of keys.
